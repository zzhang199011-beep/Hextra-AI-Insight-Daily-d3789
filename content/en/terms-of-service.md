*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into using our services, make sure you've given these Terms of Service a good read. By simply accessing or using our site, you're pretty much saying "Yep, I agree!" to everything here.

## 1. What We Offer
**The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive goodies, e-books, and community vibes. Just a heads-up, some content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no way** you can transfer or share your account with anyone else.
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you're playing dirty and violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and the fees will be super clear on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are handled by third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **we don't store any of your payment deets** on our end.
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is simple: If you're a first-time subscriber and not stoked with the service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. For anything past 14 days or if it's not your first rodeo, **no refunds, period**, unless required by law.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means hands off! No copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading only. Keep it to yourself!
- For commercial use or extensive citation, please **hit up the Site** to get permission.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a big **NO** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
- Seriously, **don't even think about** mass-downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-exclusive content using technical means.
- **The Site** can totally remove inappropriate content and **boot rule-breakers** right off the platform.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, pause, or ditch any part (or all) of our services whenever we want, without giving you a heads-up.
- **The Site** **won't be on the hook for any compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service outages.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info we dish out on the Site** is just for kicks and reference. It **does NOT constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, you name it).
- **The Site** takes **zero responsibility** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are gonna be governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- If any beef arises from or relates to these terms, we'll try to iron it out with a friendly chat first. But if that doesn't fly, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
