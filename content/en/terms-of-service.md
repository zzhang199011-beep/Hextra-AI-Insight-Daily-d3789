# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**This Site**" or "**We**")! 🎉 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of this site signifies your complete agreement and acceptance of these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
**Our services** at ai.hubtoday offer a bunch of paid subscription content and membership perks! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and vibrant community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **User accounts** require a valid email address and a password for registration.
- **You**, the user, are totally responsible for your account's security and all activity under it. Absolutely **NO** transferring or sharing your account, got it?
- **We** reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach any of these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Paid subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are processed securely through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Phew! We don't store your payment info.
- **Your subscription** will **auto-renew** like clockwork unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is simple: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one refund shot. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required. 🤔

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by ai.hubtoday** (that's us!) 🔒. No copying, reprinting, or commercial use without our explicit say-so!
- **As a user**, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access this content for your personal learning and reading only.
- **Need to use it commercially or quote a lot?** Just reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct
- **User conduct** rules are strict: Absolutely **NO** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
- And another big **NO**: Don't use any tech tricks for bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-exclusive content. Seriously, don't.
- **We** have the right to zap inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **Service changes**: We reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even completely stop any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up! 💡
- **Service interruptions** due to things like *force majeure*, server glitches, or third-party service outages that temporarily make content inaccessible? We're **not liable for any compensation** in those cases. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **Our disclaimer** is pretty straightforward: The info we provide here is purely for reference and **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff).
- **We're absolutely NOT responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just so we're clear!

## 8. Governing Law
- **Governing Law**: These Terms of Service are all about the laws of California, USA, and will be interpreted accordingly, without regard to conflict of law principles.
- **Disputes** arising from or related to these terms? We'll try to hash things out amicably first. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🤞
