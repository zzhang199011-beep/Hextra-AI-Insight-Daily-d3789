## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you to dish out certain personally identifiable info that helps us get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to:
- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets collected automatically when you're using the Service.

This Usage Data might pack details like your Device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you check out on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're hitting up the Service through a mobile device, we might automatically grab some extra info. This could be your specific mobile device type, its unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also snag info your browser sends whenever you swing by our Service or access it via a mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're all about using Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and squirrel away certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts, which help us collect and track info, plus improve and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file plonked on your Device. You can tell your browser to kick all Cookies to the curb or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, if you don't say yes to Cookies, you might miss out on some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say 'no thanks' to Cookies, our Service might just use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: Certain bits of our Service and our emails might have small electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who have zipped through those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like noting a section's popularity and checking system and server integrity).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial for dishing out the services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They're super helpful in verifying users' identities and stopping sneaky, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be delivered, and we only use 'em to give you those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about figuring out if users have given the thumbs-up to the use of Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are what let us remember the choices you make when you're cruising around the Website, like keeping your login deets or language preferences in mind. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, saving you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you use the Website.

For more deets on the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might put Personal Data to use for a few different reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a user of the Service. The Personal Data you hand over lets you access different features available to registered users.
- **For the performance of a contract**: To get things done on the purchase contract for products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've inked with us through the Service.
- **To reach out to you**: We might ping you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other similar electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app). This is to clue you in on updates or informational messages related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, whenever they're necessary or make sense.
- **To send you news**, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we're offering. This is for stuff similar to what you've already bought or inquired about, unless you've opted out of getting such info.
- **To handle your requests**: We'll process and manage any requests you throw our way.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to assess or pull off a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings, where Personal Data we hold about our Service users is among the assets being transferred.
- **For other purposes**: We might also use your info for things like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and to evaluate and jazz up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might end up sharing your personal info in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We could share your Personal Information with Service Providers to keep tabs on and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: Your Personal Information might get shared or transferred during or in negotiations of any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates. When we do, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or are under common control with.
- **With Business Partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with certain products, services, or promotions.
- **With other users**: When you share Personal Information or interact in public areas with other users, that info might be seen by all users and could even get splashed publicly outside the Service.
- **With your consent**: If you give us the green light, we might spill your Personal Information for any other reason.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent required to stick to our legal obligations (like if we need to hold onto your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company also keeps Usage Data for internal analysis. This data typically gets kept for a shorter stretch, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service or improve its functionality, or if we're legally bound to hold onto it for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing hang out. This means your info might get shuttled over to — and kept on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might differ from your neck of the woods.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving a thumbs-up to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data or ask us to help you wipe out the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you zap certain info about yourself from right inside the Service.

You can always log into your Account (if you have one!) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or delete your info. You can also get in touch with us to ask for access to, correct, or delete any Personal Information you've served up to us.

Heads up though, we might need to hang onto certain info when we're legally obliged or have a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law says so, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might genuinely believe it's necessary to spill your Personal Data for these reasons:
- To stick to a legal obligation
- To protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- To protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- To guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to shield your Personal Data, we can't promise its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we figure out we've bagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers, pronto.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we gather and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously suggest you scope out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We don't call the shots on the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we're not responsible for them whatsoever.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll clue you in on any changes by posting the fresh Privacy Policy on this very page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Those changes go live the moment they're posted on this page.
